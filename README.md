# beerTemplate - ENG
This template I've done yesterday(27.07.2018) and I'm really proud of this work!

# What is it?
It's a front-end application - website template.

# Front-end properties, used tools and techs
1) HTML5, **semantic markup**, W3C compliant, responsive layout

2) CSS, **sass**, **BEM methodology of naming**, media queries, flexbox

3) Javascript - es6, **NPM**, **GULP**, **BOWER**

# Why am I proud of this project and why it's valueble for me?
Well, at about two weeks ago I took a decision to boost my front-end skills, expand knowledge at this area. First idea, that came to my mind - is to start from **SASS**. I heard a lot about this tech and particularly about benefits of using it. But, when I opened a video on YouTube, I understood, that I need to deal with **GULP** to be able to use **SASS** in most efficient way. As you can guess, **NPM** is needed to use **GULP** conviniently, so I came to drastic idea of learning this techs. And I put an effort and finally, in a week or less, I was fluent in this techs. But, my desire to learn something wasn't satisfied, so I decided to learn how to structure my HTML5, to make it clean not only for me, but also to people who will maybe interract with my code in future. This lead me to **BEM methodology documentation** and **semantic markup in HTML5 lessons**. I consumed them rapidly and at this time, I think I was satisfied yet with amount of knowledge that I got, but something went wrong, and then I've spent a couple of days on learning **CSS GRID**. After that, I was overeaten by the theory that I got and feeled desperate desire, very powerful inner voice that said me: "MAN, YOU SHOULD PRACTISE, STRENGTHEN EVERYTHING U LEARNT". I could't struggle to it, and I've immediatly chosen the PSD free template that looked nice and decided to do my best, and creat perfect layout.

This took me a day, during all process of creation I was really really happy. Shiny, delightful feelings lead me and I was totally inspired and motivated. But the biggest pleasure I got, when I finally ended the project - it was true happiness, maybe even euphoria. Again, I reminded myself, why I adore what I do. It was cool! Even more, my memmories about proccess of developing this project still warms me a lot - **_that's why it's valuable for me._** 

And now, I understand, that all NEW techs that I learnt and apllied are very useful, they drammaticly boosted quality of my work. That means: I've spent my time **meaningfuly** - **_That's why I am really proud of this project_**
